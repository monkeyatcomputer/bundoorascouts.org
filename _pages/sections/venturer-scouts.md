## Venturer Scouts
### Teenagers Aged 14-17 Years
#### Meeting Time: Not currently meeting

Life as a Venturer Scout: Venturer Scouts never turn down a challenge, in fact, they make their own! Scaling a 30m rock-face or abseiling into caves may frighten most people but Venturer Scouts face the challenge head on and then go white water kayaking!

As a Venturer Scout you’ll work in units with other Venturer Scouts and your Adult Leaders are always available to provide you with advice, encouragement, and support. As a Venturer Scout you’re given the freedom to choose your own activities, depending on your interests, because we know that you’re most motivated to achieve when you’re passionate about what you do.

Venturer Scouts Meetings: Venturer Scout Units meet on a regular basis and Venturer Leaders are simply there to provide adult leadership and support; they act as your Scouting mentors. Unit progress is discussed at meetings, along with how each Unit is turning their goals of the Venturer Program into reality.

Socialising is a must and strong bonds are formed through teamwork and a common desire to ensure that everyone becomes the best person they can be. If you’re a Venturer Scout your only limits are the ones that you set for yourself.

### Award Scheme
The Venturer Scout Award Scheme is designed to widen Venturers’ interests and knowledge, while challenging them at the same time. It assists in planning a balanced program based on the Aims and Methods of Scouting. The Award Scheme is not compulsory for Venturer Scouts, but those who do attempt it find they have a lot of fun while discovering new things.

There are four main components to the Award Scheme. These consist of the Venturing Skills Award, the Venturer Award, the Endeavour Award and the Queen’s Scout Award. In addition, Venturers may earn a number of special badges depending on their interests.

Queen’s Scout Award: The Queen’s Scout Award is highly regarded in the community at large and the Royal Certificate is presented to the Venturer Scout by a representative of the Queen. The requirements are designed to be inspiring and challenging and to take you to a much higher and demanding level. In some States and Territories, your Queen’s Scout Award could be registered on your School Exit Certificate.

To achieve this award you must be able to: Set a goal, Plan your progress towards that goal, Organise yourself and others, and Maintain the determination to complete the task while overcoming setbacks and difficulties.
