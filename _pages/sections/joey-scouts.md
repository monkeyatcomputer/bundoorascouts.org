Joey Scouts is the youngest section of the Scouting movement. For Joey Scouts, life is an exciting adventure. They explore the wider world, stimulate their imagination and develop skills in team work.

The Joey Scout Mob meets once a week for 1 hours under the care and supervision of professionally trained Joey Scout Leaders. Parents and Guardians are welcome to join in the road to adventure with their Joey Scouts and share many new discoveries.

#### Award Scheme

There is no award scheme for Joey Scouts however there are several participation challenge badges available that Joeys can earn as a Mob. These badges are built into the weekly programs, and cover special activities including:

* A Buddy Scheme with another Mob
* Care and Share activities
* Environmental activities
* Adventure Challenge

**Promise Challenge Badge:** This is available to older Joey Scouts (must be at least 7 years old to undertake the challenge), is earned on an individual basis, and can be worn on the Cub Scout Uniform until the Grey Wolf Award (the highest Cub Scout award) is achieved.

The aim of this challenge is to allow older Joey Scouts to gain a greater understanding of the Scout Promise and Law, to learn about Scoutingâ€™s Founder, Lord Robert Baden-Powell, and to discover the history of Scouting.

The challenge requires the Joey Scout to complete certain elements, such as research and discussion with their parents and Leaders, away from the Mob meetings. The Joey will also be required to give a presentation to the Mob on completion of the task.
