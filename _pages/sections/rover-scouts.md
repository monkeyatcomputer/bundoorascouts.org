**Bundoora Scout Group is pleased to announce the Handfield Rover Unit will be hosted at the Bundoora Scout Hall Rover Den!**

"Rovers do stuff" is a popular sentiment in Rovers because we do in fact do lots of stuff!

As Rovers, we create our own adventure from start to finish, with many opportunities to build skills that are widely recognised outside of Scouting.

There are a multitude of activities, events, training experiences, and opportunities available in the Rover section, whether they be adventurous, expressive, innovative, community related or environmentally focused.

Each year we get down and dirty with the rest of Victoria’s Rovers for motorsports at Mudbash, and costumed chaos reigns at MARB, the annual Rover Ball. There’s the annual Surfmoot camp at Anglesea, or the Armstrong 500 hiking competition. You can develop your performance skills through one of the many Scout Gang Shows or Showtimes. Plus you can enjoy our very own Rover Bogong Ski Chalet near Falls Creek, or converge with Rovers from all over Australia for a ten-day activity extravaganza at the tri-annual National Moot.

The Rover section is run by Rovers at regional and state level Rover Councils, which shape our organisation and means that we are self-sufficient, with positions that any Rover can volunteer for!

Every Rover Unit is different as each has their own traditions, special interests and personalities. A Rover Unit runs itself, with an elected Unit Leader and Unit executive: the Unit Council.

Handfield Rover Unit is made up of keen people with 'give it a go' attitudes who are willing to take on new challenges for some serious fun.

Handfield Rover Unit welcomes all young adults from 18 to 25 years. You don’t need to have any Scouting experience, but you do need to keep up with some adventurous people and their adrenaline-packed adventures! A Rover Scout’s time in the Unit ends when they turn 26.

All adult members of Scouting need a Working with Children Check, but this is a small price to pay for the rewards of leadership, personal development, and the opportunity to bring a positive change to the people around you.

The Scouting movement is all about producing leaders, and here’s where Handfield Rover Unit shines. As part of the Scouting Achievement Pathway, and in line with our motto 'Service', you’ll be able to help lead activities with younger sections and other Scout Groups, contributing to the youth in the community and giving back to where we came from.

#### Rover Scout Promise

**There are two versions of the Australian Scout Promise. Individuals may select which version they wish to make.**

On my honour, I promise
To do my best,
To be true to my spiritual beliefs,
To contribute to my community and our world,
To help other people,
And to live by the Rover Scout Law.

**OR**

On my honour
I promise that I will do my best
To do my duty to my God, and
To the King of Australia,
To help other people,
And to live by the Rover Scout Law.

#### Rover Scout Law

**Be Respectful**  
Be friendly and considerate
Care for others and the environment

**Do What is Right**  
Be trustworthy, honest and fair
Use resources wisely

**Believe in Myself**  
Learn from my experiences
Face challenges with courage
