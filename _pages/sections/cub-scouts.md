Positive Development! The Cub Scout program is specifically designed to meet the developmental needs of 8 to 10 year old children. It provides opportunities for young people to develop and grow as individuals and as members of a team. Cub Scout activities are planned to cover a broad range of interests and topics to trigger their imagination and curiosity.

As a member of a 'Six' you and your Pack will work together to explore the world. Your Cub Scout Leader will help you along the way and encourage you to participate in Scouting activities. You'll learn life-long skills, participate in the Cub Scout's Award Scheme, earn badges, make friends and have fun!

#### Cub Scout Promise

**There are two versions of the Australian Scout Promise. Individuals may select which version they wish to make.**

On my honour, I promise
To do my best,
To be true to my spiritual beliefs,
To contribute to my community and our world,
To help other people,
And to live by the Cub Scout Law.

On my honour
I promise that I will do my best
To do my duty to my God, and

#### Award Scheme

The major components of the Cub Scout Award Scheme are the Bronze, Silver and Gold Boomerang badges. To earn each of these badges, Cub Scouts must complete at least ten challenges under the guidance of Leaders.

Cub Scouts can set challenges for themselves to earn Achievement Badges from the areas of Arts and Literature, Nature, Science and Technology, Sports and Recreation, and Our World. There are also a number of Special Interest badges.

**Grey Wolf Award:** This is the pinnacle of achievement in the Cub Scout Section. To earn the Grey Wolf Award a Cub Scout must hold a Gold Boomerang badge, participate in a minimum of four outdoor activities and attend two Pack Councils in the previous 12 months, complete four Level 2 Achievement badges (one from each category) and one Special Interest badge, and develop and present a resource for the Six or Pack based on the Cub Scout's understanding of The Jungle Book.
