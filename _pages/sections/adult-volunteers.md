The personal satisfaction of helping young people to achieve their goals is immense, and your sense of personal achievement when you help them through a hurdle is nearly as strong as theirs!

Where else can you take part in abseiling, rock climbing, scuba diving, and countless other adventurous activities with wonderful company and low costs? Bundoora Scout Group Leaders have incredible travel opportunities, interstate and overseas, to share discoveries with youth members.

And you're never alone, with thousands of fellow Leaders to turn to in a giant, supportive network of friends.
