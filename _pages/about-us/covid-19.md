## Current Advice

**Metro Melbourne is currently in lockdown, with the following restrictions in place:**

* All face-to-face Scouting must cease for the duration of the lockdown.
* Members who reside in locked down areas should not participate in face-to-face Scouting in Regional Victoria.
* Worker Permits are required for any activities that are undertaken during lockdown at halls, campsites and other property.

**On September 19, the Victorian government released Victoriaâ€™s Roadmap: Delivering the National Plan providing indicative dates and restrictions for opening up Victoria. Scouts Victoria's current interpretation of the plan is:**

* Metro Melbourne will remain in lockdown until 70% fully vaccinated (~Oct 26), after which there will be some limited face-face Scouting.
* Restrictions will further relax state-wide when Victoria achieves 80% fully vaccinated (~Nov 5), allowing sharing tents, larger events can occur, and masks will only be required indoors, etc.
* It is likely that some restrictions will only be relaxed for fully vaccinated Leaders and/or youth.
* The final Phase is expected when Victoria achieves 80% (including 12yo+) fully vaccinated (~Nov 19). Restrictions will relax even further, and Major Events can take place under COVIDSafe Public Event framework.
