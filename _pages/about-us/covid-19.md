## Current Restrictions

Metropolitan Melbourne will move to Step 3 on October 28 with additional easing of restrictions on November 9.

**Great news for Bundoora Scouts!**

Thanks to everyone's hard work, we're allowed to return to face-to-face Scouting.

From October 28 in Metropolitan Melbourne:
 * Bundoora Scouts can undertake face-to-face outdoor Scouting as a whole section but must be split into Patrols or small groups limited to **10 participants**. A reasonable distance between each Patrol or small group must be maintained at all times
 * Any members who live in Metropolitan Melbourne **cannot** attend any face-to-face Scouting in Regional Victoria and vice versa
 * Halls and other indoor property in Metropolitan Melbourne **remain closed** for Scouting activities but can be accessed to undertake necessary maintenance, etc.
 * Worker Permits are **no longer required** *unless* you need to travel between Regional Victoria and Metropolitan Melbourne

**Bundoora Scouts will return to the Bundoora Scout Centre for outdoor meetings from October 28.**
