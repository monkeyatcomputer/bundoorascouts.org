**Face Masks**

 * Face masks must still be worn **indoors or outdoors** if you are 12yo or over unless an exemption applies. Refer to further information on Face Masks in the [FAQs](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/covid-19-lockdown-faq/face-masks/).

**Attendance Record and QR Codes**

A record must be taken of all people who attend an indoor or outdoor Scouting activity. This includes youth members, Leaders (including visiting District leaders), helpers, carers, parents, visitors, etc.

A **COVID Check-in Marshal** is required for indoor activities. A COVID Check-in Marshal can be a nominated Leader, Adult Helper or Youth Member, etc who is responsible for ensuring that all attendees check-in using a QR Code or attendance record. The COVID Check-In Marshal can undertake other activities, but their primary responsibility should be to ensure all attendees check-in.
