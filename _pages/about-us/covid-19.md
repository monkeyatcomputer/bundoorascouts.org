## Current Advice

If a Positive Case attends Bundoora Scouts, please refer to the [Positive Cases and Contacts FAQs](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/covid-19-lockdown-faq/managing-positive-cases-and-close-contacts/).

From 11:59 pm on June 24, 2022, COVID-19 vaccinations are no longer required to attend Bundoora Scouts. The following requirements apply to Bundoora Scouts members, supporters and visitors.

**Key Changes**

* Leaders, adult helpers and other workers (such as campsite workers, etc) are no longer required to be vaccinated, unless their role includes disability care
* Parents (including rostered parents), young adult members (ie Rovers) and youth members are not required to be vaccinated
* Face masks are still required if travelling on a bus or public transport
* You only need to notify Bundoora Scouts of a positive case attending if the positive case shared accommodation or if there was more than one positive case

Further guidance is available in the [Summary of Restrictions](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/covid-19-faq/summary-of-restrictions/).

**Close Contacts**

Close contacts can now leave seven-day self-quarantine as long as they comply with specific requirements. Close contacts can attend Bundoora Scouts if they:

* are not showing any COVID-like symptoms, and
* have received a negative result from a Rapid Antigen test undertaken on the day of attendance (and each subsequent day for an overnight event), and
* wear a face mask indoors (unless an exception applies), and
* do not share accommodation, such as tents, bunkhouses or hall sleepovers.

**COVID Testing**

It is recommended that all attendees (including youth members, young adult members, leaders, adult helpers, parents, etc) receive a negative COVID test (PCR or Rapid Antigen) within 48 hours prior to attending an activity that includes:

* Sharing a tent or other accommodation such as cabins or bunkhouses
* Sleepover at a hall or similar property

COVID Testing may also be required at some Major Events.

A COVID test undertaken as part of work or school surveillance is acceptable to demonstrate a negative COVID test.

Where a COVID test could not be undertaken within 48 hours prior to attending an event, the participant should stay in single person accommodation until a COVID test can be performed.
