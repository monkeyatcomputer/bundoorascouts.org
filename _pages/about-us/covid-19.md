 * Can have 20 youth participants* but 1.5m physical distancing will be maintained at all times
 * Rooms smaller than 80sqm can have 1 participant* per 4 sqm

### Outdoor Scouting

 * Face-to-face outdoor Scouting can be undertaken as a whole Unit (up to 50 participants*). Units no longer need to be split into Patrols or small groups for outdoor activities.
 * Face masks do not need to be worn outdoors unless physical distancing cannot be achieved for an extended period
 * Overnight camping for one or more nights is permitted in Patrols or small groups of up to 15 participants*. Tents, cabins or bunkhouses can be used and shared amongst the 15 participant group.
