## Current Advice

From 11:59 pm on October 12, 2022, the coronavirus pandemic declaration in Victoria comes to an end.

**Key Changes**

* **It is strongly recommended that positive cases do not attend Scouting if they have symptoms**
* Youth and adult members are not required to be vaccinated unless their role includes disability care. Keeping up to date with COVID vaccinations is still strongly recommended as current data indicates that vaccination remains 95% effective in preventing loss of life from COVID-19
* There is no requirement to have a negative COVID test prior to attending a Scouting activity and pre-event COVID screening is no longer required
* There are no limits on the number who can attend Scouting or share a tent
* Face masks are not required in Scout Halls or on buses but are strongly recommended for close contacts attending indoor Scouting.
* There is no longer a requirement to notify Scouts Victoria if a positive case attended Scouting.
* COVIDSafe Plans are not required

**Reminder:** Activities away from your District must still be registered in Out and About.

*This webpage and associated FAQs are regularly updated to provide the latest Scouts Victoria guidance on current COVID-19 restrictions.*
