## Current Advice

From 11:59 pm on October 12, 2022, the coronavirus pandemic declaration in Victoria comes to an end.

With that, this page has now been retired. COVID-19 is still around, and we're following any directives we are required to, but there won't be any more updates to this page.

Not that anyone really wants to relive the last three and a bit years, but it's interesting to [see the changes to this page](https://github.com/monkeyatcomputer/bundoorascouts.org/commits/master/_pages/about-us/covid-19.md "covid-19.md GitHub commit history") going back to its creation in mid 2020.
