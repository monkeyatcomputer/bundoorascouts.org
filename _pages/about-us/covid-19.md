The [COVID-19 Mandatory Vaccination (Workers) Directions](https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/202110/covid-19-mandatory-vaccination-%28workers%29-directions.pdf) affect all Scouts Victoria employees and volunteer workers engaged in Scouting state-wide, including Leaders, helpers, committee members, fellowship, etc. It does not apply to youth members unless they are involved as workers (such as youth helpers, or Rovers who are also Leaders or are helping on activities).
