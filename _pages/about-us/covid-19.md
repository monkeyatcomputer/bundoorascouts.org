## Current Advice

From 11:59 pm on April 22, 2022, COVID-19 restrictions have significantly relaxed across Victoria. The following requirements apply to Scouts Victoria members, supporters and visitors. Further guidance is available in the [Summary of Restrictions](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/covid-19-lockdown-faq/summary-of-changes/).

**Key Changes**

* Only Leaders, adult helpers and other workers (such as campsite workers, etc) need to be fully vaccinated and have received at least 2 doses of COVID vaccine or have a medical exemption
* Parents (including rostered parents), young adult members (ie Rovers) and youth members are not required to be vaccinated
* QR Code Check-in and COVID Check-in Marshals are no longer required
* Face masks are not required unless travelling on a bus or public transport

**Close Contacts**

Close contacts can now leave seven-day self-quarantine as long as they comply with specific requirements. Close contacts can attend Scouting if they:

* are not showing any COVID-like symptoms, and
* have received a negative result from a Rapid Antigen test undertaken on the day of attendance (and each subsequent day for an overnight event), and
* wear a face mask indoors (unless an exception applies), and
* do not share accommodation, such as tents, bunkhouses or hall sleepovers.

**COVID Testing**

It is recommended that all attendees (including youth members, young adult members, leaders, adult helpers, parents, etc) receive a negative COVID test (PCR or Rapid Antigen) within 48 hours prior to attending an activity that includes:

* Sharing a tent or other accommodation such as cabins or bunkhouses
* Sleepover at a hall or similar property
* COVID Testing may also be required at some Major Events (see below).

A COVID test undertaken as part of work or school surveillance is acceptable to demonstrate a negative COVID test.

Where a COVID test could not be undertaken within 48 hours prior to attending an event, the participant should stay in single person accommodation until a COVID test can be performed.

Further COVID guidance for Scouting is available on the [Summary of Restrictions](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/covid-19-lockdown-faq/summary-of-changes/) page or in the [COVID-19 FAQs](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/covid-19-faq/).
