## Current Advice

**From October 15 2021, unvaccinated volunteer workers are unable to undertake face-to-face Scouting unless:**

* they have a confirmed booking for a 1st dose by October 22 2021, or
* they are an excepted person holding certification from a medical practitioner that they are unable to receive a vaccination due to a medical contraindication or an acute medical illness.

The [COVID-19 Mandatory Vaccination (Workers) Directions](https://www.dhhs.vic.gov.au/sites/default/files/documents/202110/covid-19-mandatory-vaccination-%28workers%29-directions.pdf) affect all Scouts Victoria employees and volunteer workers engaged in Scouting state-wide, including Leaders, helpers, committee members, fellowship, etc. It does not apply to youth members unless they are involved as workers (such as youth helpers, or Rovers who are also Leaders or are helping on activities).

Under the Directions, Scouts Victoria is also required to collect and record the vaccination status of all volunteers.

The Worker Directions do not apply to youth members or unregistered parents unless they are involved as workers (such as Rovers who are also Leaders, are helping on activities, or are undertaking projects in the community).

**From October 22, it is likely that some mandatory vaccination requirements will also apply to Scouting participants aged 12yo and over. We are waiting on further details to be released in the coming days.**

Further guidance on Vaccination for Scouting is available in the [Vaccination FAQs](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/covid-19-lockdown-faq/vaccination/).

**Scouts Victoria has developed a [Scouting Roadmap](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/media/6342/scouts-victoria-roadmap-for-covid-oct12.pdf) to provide guidance on how [Victoria’s Roadmap: Delivering the National Plan](https://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au/victorias-roadmap) may affect a return to face-to-face Scouting. The key milestones are:**

* Regional Victoria will have limited indoor and outdoor Scouting until Victoria achieves 70% fully vaccinated on October 22, after which some restrictions will relax outdoors.
* Metro Melbourne will remain in lockdown until October 22, after which there will be outdoor face-to-face Scouting. There may also be limited indoor Scouting, but that is yet to be confirmed.
* From October 22, up to 6 people can share a tent while camping and up to 10 can have a sleepover at a hall. Campsites can take public bookings of up to 10 people from multiple households.
* It is possible that there will be some restrictions on unvaccinated youth members (aged 12 years and over).
* Restrictions will further relax state-wide when Victoria achieves 80% fully vaccinated, estimated to be between **November 1 and 5**, including allowing indoor activities, sharing tents, larger events, and face masks will only be required indoors, and major events can take place under the COVIDSafe Public Event framework, etc.
* The final Phase is expected when Victoria achieves its final target, and restrictions will relax even further. This is likely to be sometime after the end of November.
* You can access a Scouts Victoria Vaccination Tracker and Predictor at the bottom of the [COVID-19 Lockdown FAQs](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/covid-19-lockdown-faq/) page.

**The following restrictions are currently in place Metropolitan Melbourne (and locked down areas of Regional Victoria) until 23:59 on October 21, 2021:**

* All face-to-face Scouting within locked down areas must cease for the duration of the lockdown.
* Members who reside in locked down areas should not participate in face-to-face Scouting in Regional Victoria.
* Worker Permits are required for any work that needs to be undertaken during lockdown at halls, campsites and other property until Victoria achieves 70% fully vaccinated.

**Further COVID guidance for Scouting is available on the [Summary of Restrictions](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/covid-19-lockdown-faq/summary-of-changes/) page or in the [COVID-19 Lockdown FAQs](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/covid-19-lockdown-faq/).**

**Face Masks**

Face masks must still be worn indoors or outdoors state-wide if you are 12 years old or over unless an exemption applies.

Although Primary School children in Years 3 to 6 are required to wear face masks when indoors at school, this is not a requirement for Scouting, whether indoors or outdoors.  

Refer to further information in the [Face Masks FAQs](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/covid-19-lockdown-faq/face-masks/).
