We're so thankful for the dedication and generosity of our family of sponsors. This is more than just a
listing of logos â€“ this is a group of organizations who truly support their community and our Scouting
goals.

As a totally voluntarily run Scout group, we rely on our fantastic sponsors and fundraising events to
survive and provide the Scouting program to our youth members. For you, it is an oppportunity to give
back to an organization that encourages physical, intellectual, social and spritual development of
young people so that they may take a contructive place in society as respectful and responsible citizens.
