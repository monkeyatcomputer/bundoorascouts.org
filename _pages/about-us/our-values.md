## Australian Scout Promise

On my honour,

To be true to my spiritual beliefs,  
To contribute to my community  
and our world,  
To help other people,  
And to live by the Scout Law  

**OR**

On my honour,  
I promise to do my best,  
To do my duty to my God,  
And to the Queen of Australia,  
To help other people,  
And to live by the Scout Law  

Members choose which version they wish to take, allowing all members to commit to Scouting in line with their personal beliefs.

## Australian Scout Law

**BE RESPECTFUL**

Be friendly and considerate  
Care for others and the environment

**DO WHAT IS RIGHT**

Be trustworthy, honest and fair  
Use resources wisely

**BELIEVE IN MYSELF**

Learn from my experiences  
Face challenges with courage

There is a single Scout Law which allows increasingly mature degrees of interpretation, starting with a basic understanding by Joey Scouts but providing for plenty of discussion among older members.
