# What It Means to be a Scout
The Mission of Scouting is to contribute to the education of young people, through a value system based on the Scout Promise and Law, to help build a better world where people are self-fulfilled as individuals and play a constructive role in society.

We achieve this by:
 * Involving young people through their formative years in a non-formal education process.
 * Using a specific method that makes each individual the principal agent in his or her development as a self-reliant, supportive and committed person.
 * Assisting them to establish a value system based upon spiritual, social and personal principles as expressed in the Promise and Law.
