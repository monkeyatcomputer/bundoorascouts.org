## Welcome
Congratulations on joining your local Scout Group!

Your child is now part of a global organisation which today has more than 50 million members.

Over the past 110 years more than two billion young people have benefited from the Scouting program.

In Victoria there are Scout Groups like yours in 400 local communities.

Our Scout Groups are run by local families who help make Scouting the best possible experience for their children.

In this Guide you’ll find some details about how Scouting works. In particular, there are some suggestions on how parents and caregivers can help their children get the most from their time in Scouting.

Welcome to Scouting! We wish your family lots of fun, friendship, adventure, and safe times ahead.

## The benefits of Scouting

There are many lifelong advantages that young people get from their years enjoying Scouting with friends and family. Here are some of the opportunities your child will get:

**Resilience**

In 2018 the Resilient Youth Australia survey of our youth members highlighted some of the benefits of Scouting. These are included in the centre pages of this Parent Guide. The main benefit is above-average Resilience – the strength to deal with the challenges of modern life.

**Mental Health**

The 2016 UK Childhood Study found that former Scouts are 18% less likely to suffer mood or anxiety disorders than nonScouts, even decades later, as adults. The study said programs like Scouting that support resilience, social mobility, ‘soft’ non-cognitive skills, self-reliance, collaboration, and activities in natural environments may help protect mental health in adulthood.

**Leadership**

Unlike school or sport, in Scouting every young person gets a chance at developing their skills in leadership. Scouting is literally developing Victoria’s leaders of the future.

**Academic Outcomes**

Scouting is linked with better school results, especially at upper secondary levels. The meta-research of Prof. John Hattie, of the University of Melbourne, shows that secondary students do better when they do an extra-curricular activity which is organised and structured, with regular programs, increasingly complex skill building, leadership by one or more competent adults, a social network, leadership opportunities, and age-appropriate goals and expectations. This sounds exactly like Scouting!

## What is Scouting?

Scouting is a non-formal type of education.

Young people learn new skills and responsible independence through the Scout Method. Although our programs are continually updated to remain contemporary, the Scout Method has stood the test of time.

Elements of the Scout Method include:

**Learning by doing**
 * Young people learn best through practical experiences, not theory.

**Learning in small teams**

 * Leadership and social skills are developed through teamwork and a sense of belonging.

**Learning outdoors**

 * The outdoors is our main location for learning. This encourages a twoway relationship between the individual and the natural world.

**Community involvement**

 * Scouts of all ages actively explore and learn about their responsibility to their community and the wider world.

**Personal progression**

 * The learning journey focuses on challenging each individual to do their best through a range of experiences.

**The Scout Promise and Law**

 * These are a simple set of common values that underpin all Scouting activities and interactions.

**Youth leading, and Adults supporting**

 * As they progress through the Sections of Scouting, young people are increasingly self-managing. With help from their volunteer adult Leaders.

## What is the program?

A good program includes lots of different adventures, lots of time in the outdoors, and has significant input from the youth members themselves. A basic part of the program is the Award Scheme – the badges that Joey Scouts earn toward their Promise Challenge, Cub Scouts toward their Grey Wolf, Scouts toward their Australian Scout Medallion, Venturers toward their Queen’s Scout award, and Rovers toward their Baden-Powell Rover Scout award. Details of these are set out in handbooks and on websites. Or ask your child’s Leader for information.

And while many strive for these peak awards, they’re not for everyone. Some youth members are happy to enjoy camps, weeknight meetings and occasionally achieve badges. 
Scouts Australia is currently transitioning toward a new program, One Program for all Sections – Joeys, Cubs, Scouts, Venturers and Rovers – where the skills learned in younger Sections are built on at each level.

## What is the uniform?

The basic uniform is the shirt and scarf (which is usually held together by a woggle, often a piece of leather). The shirt is available from [The Scout Shop](http://scoutshop.com.au/) for A$36.95 (incl-GST) for Joeys to A$51.95 (incl-GST) for Rovers. The scarf is usually supplied by your Group. (Every Scout Group is proud of its own colours.)

Check with your Leader if you also need to order a woggle A$3.95 (incl-GST) and belt A$14.95 (incl-GST).

**All prices are subject to change.**

## What is the cost?
Every Scout Group charges an annual (or term-by-term) fee which covers the annual fee payable to Scouts Victoria, and a Group fee to cover costs such as rates, power, equipment, insurance, Leader training, and more. This varies from Group to Group depending on local factors such as how much fundraising the Group does, other financial pressures (eg hall maintenance).

Annual fees in Victoria range from A$300 to A$500+ (inc-GST).

There is also the cost of activities such as camps. These are kept as low as possible because we usually use our own campsites and Leaders are unpaid volunteers. Major events held every few years (like Cuboree and Jamboree) cost more because of the scale of the program and entertainment, but most Groups work together to lower the individual cost, through fundraising. Financial issues should not be a barrier to any child being a Scout.  If you have any concerns, please speak with your Group Leader to discuss payment options.

## Values
Scouting is a values-based organisation.

The Scout Promise and the Scout Law underpin this. Every member of Scouting in the world makes the Scout Promise when they first join Scouting, and at major milestones in their Scouting journey. This includes an undertaking to live by the Scout Law.

The **Scout Law** is a simple code for living.

The **Scout Promise** comes in two forms, and members choose which version they wish to make.

That is, the version which best aligns with their beliefs. Both versions include a pledge to ‘help other people’, as helping others is a fundamental value of Scouting.

### The Scout Law

**BE RESPECTFUL**
 - Be friendly and considerate
 - Care for others and the environment

**DO WHAT IS RIGHT**

 - Be trustworthy, honest and fair
 - Use resources wisely

**BELIEVE IN MYSELF**

 - Learn from my experiences
 - Face challenges with courage

### The Scout Promise

On my honour,  
I promise to do my best,  
To be true to my spiritual beliefs,  
To contribute to my community and our world,  
To help other people,  
And to live by the Scout Law

**OR**

On my honour,  
I promise to do my best,  
To do my duty to my God,  
And to the Queen of Australia,  
To help other people,  
And to live by the Scout Law 

### How we treat each other in Scouting
All uniformed members make the Scout Promise and strive to live up to the Scout Law.

It’s a code for life, and each of us tries to do our best.

But it also applies to how we treat each other.

And that’s the same for all of us - Joeys, Cubs, Scouts, Venturers and Rovers; Leaders and Adult Helpers; office-bearers, Fellowship and other supporters; and parents. 

We all have rights and we all have responsibilities. These include:

| RIGHTS | RESPONSIBILITIES |
| ------ | ---------------- |
| To be respected | We listen to each other, speak calmly, and consider all views. |
| To trust and be trusted | We are honest in our relationships and discussions. |
| To learn | We understand that mistakes are part of learning. We celebrate each other’s achievement. |
| To be supported | Everyone helps each other in Scouting. We are all responsible for ensuring that others are OK. |
| To have fun | We have fun in Scouting but that must not impact negatively on others. |
| To be safe | We don’t harass others, physically or verbally or online. Or let others do this. |
