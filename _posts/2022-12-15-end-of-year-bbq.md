Thursday, December 15th saw the Group's end of year BBQ and award night.

Many thanks to everyone that came to see our new Joey Scouts leader, Joey Scout and parent helper being invested.

Congratulations to our Scout leader Hamish for completing and being awarded the [Wood Badge](https://scouts.com.au/members/training/adult-training/).

Thankyou also to our Cub Scout leader Kate, for 10 years of service to Scouts Victoria.

Bundoora Scout Group extends a warm welcome to the Handfield Rover Crew. We're looking forward to working with the Handfield Rover Crew to refurbish the Rover Den and many other great projects.

That's a wrap for 2022! Please enjoy some snaps from the evening.
