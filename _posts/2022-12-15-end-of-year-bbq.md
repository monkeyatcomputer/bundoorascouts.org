As the year 2022 comes to a close, it’s time to reflect on the past 12 months of scouting adventures at Bundoora Scouts. This year has been a rollercoaster of ups and downs, but despite the challenges, our scouts have continued to thrive and make the most of every opportunity.

Thursday, December 15th saw the Group's end of year BBQ and award night. Highlights from the evening included:

* Our new Joey Scout leader being invested!
* A new Joey Scout being invested to our mob.
* Scout leader Hamish being presented with the [Wood Badge](https://scouts.com.au/members/training/adult-training/).
* Cub Scout leader Kate, for 10 years of service to Scouts Victoria.
* Welcome to the Handfield Rover Crew - We're looking forward to working with the Handfield Rover Crew to refurbish the Rover Den and many other great projects.

Thank you to our dedicated leaders and volunteers who have made it all possible. Your time, energy, and passion for scouting have been an inspiration to our scouts and we couldn’t have done it without you.

Looking ahead to 2023, we have many exciting plans and opportunities in the works, and we can’t wait to see what adventures await us. Happy New Year to all our scouts, leaders, and families!

Yours in Scouting,  
Chris
