### CONGRATULATIONS TO: Taneesha Pattison

Bundoora Scout Group is very excited to announce that, for the first time since 1992, we have a Queen's Scout. We are very proud to announce that Taneesha Pattison has been approved for the prestigious award having completed all the technical requirements and undergoing a rigorous character check, Taneesha will, sometime in February be invested as a Queens Scout. An amazing feat during a year of Covid and (almost) on her own.

A massive congratulations to Taneesha for all her hard work from everyone at Bundoora Scouts.
