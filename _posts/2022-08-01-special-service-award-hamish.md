### CONGRATULATIONS TO: Hamish

Congratulations to Bundoora's very own amazing scout leader, Hamish, for being awarded the [https://scouts.com.au/](Scouts Australia) [https://scouts.com.au/about/what-is-scouting/awards/](Special Service Award) on [https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/age-sections-adults/leader-resources/marketing/world-scout-day-2022/](World Scout Day). Awarded to both Adult Members and Supporters for the successful support, development or management of a Section or Formation, or for an intense contribution over a period of at least 12 months to the success of a major event or major activity. 'Special Service' is defined as making a noteworthy contribution in their role. This Award can be made in the first three year assignment / period of service.

Hamish is one of only two Leaders still with us after Bundoora Scout Group came under new management four years ago. Starting in Cubs, his Leadership skills have gone to new heights. Now Scout Leader, he has undertaken two [https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/activities-events/events/cubs/](Cuborees) and [https://www.vicjam.com.au/](Vic Jam), grown the Scout Section from 7 to 17 and with Kirsty, has put our Scouts squarely back on track after a horrid two years of COVID.

Thanks Hamish for all you do for us at Bundoora.
