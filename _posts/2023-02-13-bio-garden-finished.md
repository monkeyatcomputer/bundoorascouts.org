The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the world in more ways than one. From social distancing to lockdowns, the virus  impacted every aspect of our lives, including projects like the Bundoora Scouts bio garden. However, despite the setbacks caused by the pandemic, our bio garden has finally been completed! This is a great achievement, not just for the Bundoora Cub Scouts but also for the community at large.

The bio garden was initially started as a project to promote environmental awareness in our youth members. Started in early 2021 and was expected to be completed within 6 months. However, the pandemic forced Bundoora Scouts to put the project on hold for several months. With restrictions on social gatherings and movement, it was impossible to continue working on the garden. However, the Scouts did not give up. Instead, they used the downtime to plan and refine their ideas for the garden. The Scouts worked tirelessly to complete the project, and now in 2023 we're pleased to announce that the Bundoora Cub Scouts bio garden is finally finished.

The completion of the Bundoora Scouts bio garden is a testament to the resilience and determination of the Scouts and the community as a whole. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, our Scouts never gave up on their vision of creating a sustainable, environmentally-friendly garden. The garden is now a valuable resource for the local community, providing educational opportunities, and a space for people to come together and connect with nature.

In addition to promoting environmental awareness, the bio garden also serves as a means of preserving and promoting the indigenous plant species in the local area. Native plants that are endemic to the Bundoora area have been carefully selected and identified with name stakes so that the Cub Scouts can easily identify them. This knowledge can be used to encourage the Scouts and the wider community to plant endemic species in their own backyards, helping to preserve local ecosystems and promote biodiversity. By educating our Scouts on the importance of using locally endemic plants in their gardens, the Bundoora Scouts bio garden is contributing to the larger goal of promoting sustainable living practices that prioritize the protection of the environment.

The Bundoora Scouts bio garden is not just a place for native flora but also a hub for creating artificial habitats for local wildlife. The Scouts have installed various artificial habitats, such as bird boxes, bug hotels, and frog bogs, to provide shelter and breeding grounds for the local fauna. These habitats have been designed to mimic the natural environments that these animals would typically inhabit, creating safe spaces for them to live and thrive. The bird boxes are strategically placed throughout the garden to encourage nesting, while the bug hotels provide shelter for various insects such as ladybugs, lacewings, and solitary bees. The frog bogs are perfect for amphibians and provide a habitat for tadpoles to grow and develop. The garden is now a haven for a diverse range of creatures, creating an ecosystem that is both productive and balanced.

In conclusion, the completion of the Bundoora Scouts bio garden is a shining example of what can be achieved when Scouts come together to work towards a common goal. The pandemic may have caused significant delays in the project, but it did not dampen the spirit or determination of the Scouts. The garden is now a source of pride and inspiration for the community and a reminder that even in the face of adversity, we can still achieve great things.

Yours in Scouting,
