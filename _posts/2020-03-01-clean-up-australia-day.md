Bundoora Scouts joined local volunteer conservation group [Friends of the Wildlife Reserves](https://www.fotwlr.org.au/) for [Clean Up Australia Day 2020](https://www.cleanup.org.au/clean-up-australia-dayd23f0508) at [Gresswell Forest Nature Conservation Reserve](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Gresswell+Forest+Wildlife+Reserve,+Macleod+VIC+3085/@-37.7107883,145.0706431,17z/). Much of the local storm drainage system ends up in Gresswell Forest and unfortunately a lot of rubbish too. All of the volunteers split in to three groups, with Bundoora Scouts tackling the North West corner wetlands leading to Salt Creek.
