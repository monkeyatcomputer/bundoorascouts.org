Thank you parents and members of Bundoora Scout Group that helped on Saturday. Our hall and grounds are looking better than ever thanks to your efforts. Thanks again Chris Parr for coordinating our working bee day.

Everyone pitched in to help:
 - Finish the kitchen and move stuff back in
 - Label all the boxes in the resource Room
 - Pack tents away
 - Mow the grass
 - Wash the windows
 - Clean up all debris around the new fence
 - Cut back bushes.

One of our Cubs, Daniel, recorded surprise man-on-the-street interviews of everyone hard at work cooking lunch, creating a lockable storage space for a weekly hall hire group, cleaning up and organising equipment in our new kitchen. Thanks Daniel!
