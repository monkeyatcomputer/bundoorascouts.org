Bundoora Scouts had an exciting and memorable event today, as we held a BBQ with some special guests. Among those in attendance was our local [Victorian State Government](https://www.vic.gov.au/) [Member for Bundoora](https://new.parliament.vic.gov.au/members/colin-brooks/), the [Honourable Colin Brooks](https://www.colinbrooks.com.au/).

The event started with a warm welcome from the [Bundoora Scouts leaders]({% link _pages/about-us/our-leaders.md %}), who expressed their gratitude for everyone's attendance and the continued support of the local community. The Scouts were thrilled to have the Hon. Colin Brooks join them, and they eagerly showed him around Bundoora Scout Centre including all of the projects that have been completed and our future plans.

As the BBQ got underway, the Scouts and their families enjoyed some delicious food and refreshments while chatting and catching up with each other. It was a great opportunity for everyone to socialize and enjoy the beautiful weather.

Bundoora Scouts, on behalf of [Scouts Victoria](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/), presented Hon. Colin Brooks with the '[Scouts Victoria Ambassador Scarf](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/media/6435/policy-adult-membership-nov2021.pdf)'. The scarf is presented to, and worn by, individuals who support the Aim and Principles of the Association. They may include distinguished citizens, sponsors or others who give material or other forms of support.

The Hon. Colin Brooks also took the time to speak to the Scouts and their families, emphasizing the role of Scouts in building strong and resilient communities. He commended the Bundoora Scouts for their contributions to the local area and encouraged them to continue their good work.

Overall, the Bundoora Scouts family BBQ was a huge success, thanks to the hard work and dedication of the leaders and the support of the community. The presence of the Hon. Colin Brooks made the event even more special, and the Scouts were honored to have him join us.

Yours in Scouting,  
Chris
