Our Joey Scout mob held a sleep over at the hall as practise for Kangaree the following weekend. Before bed we cooked pancakes in the new kitchen and watched a movie. The next morning, we up early for breakfast followed by a very special video call with a Beaver Scout pack in England! As it was also Cleanup Australia day, we did our part to cleanup N.J. Telfer reserve which surrounds the Bundoora Scout Hall.
