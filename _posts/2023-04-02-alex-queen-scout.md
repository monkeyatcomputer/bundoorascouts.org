### CONGRATULATIONS TO: Alex Chung

We are thrilled to share with you the wonderful news that Alex Chung of Handfield Rover Crew has been awarded the [Queen's Scout Award](https://scoutsvictoria.com.au/activities-events/activity-teams/heritage/kings-and-queens-scout-honour-roll/). This  award is the highest honor that a Venturer Scout in Australia can achieve, and it recognizes Alex's hard work, dedication, and outstanding contribution to the Scouting movement.

To achieve this prestigious award today, a Venturer Scout must be able to set personal goals, plan and organise activities with themselves and others. They are required to maintain a high level of determination to reach milestones and complete attainment to the very best of their abilities.

Alex Chung has exemplified all of these qualities and more. He has shown great leadership and teamwork skills, and has inspired his fellow Scouts to strive for excellence.

Alex's commitment to Scouting and to his community is truly inspiring. He has made a lasting impact on the lives of those around him, and has set a wonderful example for future generations of Scouts. We are proud to call him a member of the Handfield Rover Crew, and we offer our heartfelt congratulations on his well-deserved achievement of the Queen's Scout Award.

Yours in Scouting,  
Chris
