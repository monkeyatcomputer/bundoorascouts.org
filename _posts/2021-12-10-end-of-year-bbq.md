Last Friday saw the Group's wrap up for the year with a wonderful family BBQ. Two Cub Scouts were awarded their Grey Wolf Award and the Group presented it's honour board to commemorate this special occasion. The Group was also presented with it's First Aid Kit from the Freemasons, with both the Worshipful Master and Brother Peter Trenery in attendance. The Group made some very important thankyou's to several in our community who have done some fantastic work on behalf of our Scout Group.

Frank Gardam, a long time local, helps us manage our bins and we appreciate all his efforts for our Group.

Cr Rick Garotti another good friend of the Scout Group, who last year led the charge for all Scout Groups to share in over half a million in capital funding.

Laurie Fitzpatrick, our resident electrician who was honoured with a Chief Commissioner's Award. Presented by the Acting Chief Commissioner, Robert Taylor who gave an excellent overview of all the work Laurie has done for the Group over the past few years. Interestingly, the only one to be presented in the past three years. Congrats Laurie!

That's a wrap for this year and good luck to all our members attending VicJam! May the Sun be at your back and the sunscreen on your back!
