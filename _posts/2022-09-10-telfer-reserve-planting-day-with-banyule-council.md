Many thanks to everyone who attended our planting day at the [NJ Telfer Reserve](https://www.google.com/maps/place/N+J+Telfer+Reserve,+Bundoora+VIC+3083/) in Bundoora. With the help of [Banyule Council](https://www.banyule.vic.gov.au/) and our very own local councillor, Rick Garotti, we planted four garden beds to help improve the landscape under the high voltage power lines.
