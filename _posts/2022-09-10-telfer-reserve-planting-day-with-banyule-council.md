Bundoora Scouts and [Banyule Council](https://www.banyule.vic.gov.au/) recently joined forces for a planting day at [NJ Telfer Reserve](https://www.google.com/maps/place/N+J+Telfer+Reserve,+Bundoora+VIC+3083/), a local park and natural area. The event was an opportunity for members of the community to come together and contribute to the preservation and beautification of the park.

The planting day was a collaborative effort between the Bundoora Scouts and Banyule Council. Participants worked together to plant a variety of native trees and shrubs, with the goal of improving the park's ecosystem and providing habitat for local wildlife. The park is an important green space for the community, and the planting day helped to ensure that it will be enjoyed for generations to come.

Bundoora Scouts were an integral part of the planting day, lending their energy and enthusiasm to the project. Scouts worked alongside council staff and other volunteers to plant the trees and shrubs, and to learn about the importance of preserving local green spaces. It was a great opportunity for the Scouts to develop their teamwork and leadership skills, while also making a positive impact on their community.

Banyule Council also played a key role in the planting day, providing the necessary resources and expertise to make the project a success. Council staff provided guidance on the best types of plants to use, and helped to ensure that the park would continue to thrive in the years to come. Special mention to Councillor Rick Garotti for helping on the day.

The planting day at NJ Telfer Reserve was a wonderful example of community spirit and environmental stewardship. Bundoora Scouts and Banyule Council should be proud of the work they have done, and the positive impact they have had on their community. The park will serve as a lasting legacy of their efforts, and as a reminder of the importance of preserving our local green spaces for future generations.
