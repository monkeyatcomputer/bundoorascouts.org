Bundoora Scout Group held our end of year group camp on the 6th, 7th and 8th of December at the Bundoora Scout Hall with all sections.

Friday evening saw everyone pitch in to set up tents and prepare a BBQ dinner. Followed by kids, big and little, bouncing around on the jumping castle with a movie before turning in.

Early Saturday morning we boarded a bus, train and tram to the [Shrine of Rememberence](https://www.shrine.org.au/) on St Kilda Road in Melbourne. On arrival we were greeted by our guide Bruce who gave the group a very personal tour of the building and surrounds. On return to the hall, and after some more jumping castle bouncing, we all enjoyed a roast dinner prepared by *Mang* (Sarah) in our amazing new kitchen.

Sunday morning everyone pitched again to pack up tents after breakfast, before heading home (to catch up on sleep).

Many thanks to; our [Shrine of Rememberence](https://www.shrine.org.au/) guide Bruce, *Eagle's* (Kirsty) awesome planning, and our leaders *Akela* (Hamish), *Bagheera* (Peter), *Eagle* (Melissa), *Mang* (Sarah), *Platypus* (Sue), and our group leader *Rafiki* (Chris).
