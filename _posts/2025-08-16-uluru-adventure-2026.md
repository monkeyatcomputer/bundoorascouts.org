Get ready for an expedition to the spiritual heart of Australia! The Bundoora Scout Group is planning a major trip to Uluru and the surrounding Central Australian landscape in 2026. This is a fantastic opportunity for our Scouts and Venturer Scouts to experience the rich culture and breathtaking scenery of the Australian Outback.

This trip is open to registered members of the <b>Scout</b> and <b>Venturer Scout</b> sections who will be of age at the time of the trip. This is a significant expedition and will require a good level of maturity, fitness, and a commitment to teamwork.
