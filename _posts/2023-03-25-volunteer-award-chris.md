### CONGRATULATIONS TO: Chris

It gives us great pleasure to extend our warmest congratulations to Bundoora Scout's own Group Leader, Chris Parr on receiving the [Jagajaga Community Volunteer Award for 2023](https://www.katethwaites.com/volunteer-awards/). This  award recognizes Chris' outstanding contribution to the community and his dedication to making a positive impact on the lives of others.

As the leader of the Bundoora Scouts Group, Chris has worked tirelessly to provide a safe and nurturing environment for young people to learn, grow, and develop important life skills. Through his leadership and guidance, countless children have been able to develop their confidence, teamwork, and leadership abilities, all while having fun and making new friends.

Chris's commitment to the Bundoora community extends beyond his work with the Scouts. He has also been actively involved in a range of local initiatives, including environmental conservation, community events, and fundraising for charity. His selflessness and dedication to improving the lives of those around him are truly inspiring.

The Jagajaga Community Volunteer Award is a fitting recognition of Chris's hard work and dedication. It is a testament to his exceptional character, leadership, and tireless commitment to making a positive impact on the world.

In speaking with Chris  about receiving the Jagajaga Community Volunteer Award for 2023, he expressed his gratitude and deep appreciation for the recognition. However, he also humbly noted that he believes the award is more about the youth members and leaders of the Bundoora Scouts Group than it is about himself.

According to Chris, the real reward comes from seeing the positive impact that the Scouts program has on the young people in his community. He sees the award as a testament to the hard work and dedication of all the volunteers and leaders who work tirelessly to create a safe, supportive, and engaging environment for children to learn and grow.

On behalf of the entire community, we would like to extend our heartfelt congratulations to Chris Parr on this well-deserved recognition. Thank you for your incredible service, dedication, and leadership. You are a true inspiration to us all, and we are fortunate to have you as our group leader and a valued member of the community.

Yours in Scouting,  
Everyone at the Bundoora Scout Group!
