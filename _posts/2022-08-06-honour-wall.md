Bundoora Scouts  is proud to announce the completion of its new Honour Board Wall, a testament to the hard work and dedication of its members over the years. The wall, located near the kitchen, is a fitting tribute to the achievements and contributions of Scouts both past and present.

The Honour Board Wall is comprised of a series of plaques, each bearing the names of Scouts who have earned a top award or recognition within the group. The awards include the Queen's Scout Award, and the Grey Wolf Award.

The completion of the Honour Board Wall is a significant milestone for the Bundoora Scouts. It provides a permanent record of the achievements of its members and serves as a source of inspiration for future generations of Scouts. The wall is a reminder of the importance of hard work, dedication, and perseverance, and will be a source of pride for the entire Bundoora Scouts community for years to come.

The Bundoora Scouts would like to extend a warm invitation to all members, past and present, to come and visit the new Honour Board Wall. It is a testament to the achievements of the group and serves as a reminder of the great work that has been done and the contributions made by its members.

Plenty of space for more honour boards too!
