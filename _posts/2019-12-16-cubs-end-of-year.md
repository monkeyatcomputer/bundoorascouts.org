Bundoora Cub Scout Pack held our end of year meeting at Latitude in Bundoora. Much bouncing was had combined with dodgeball, basketball, ninja warrior and a high wire obstacle course. We also invested our newest member Adam and welcomed Syrus to the pack.

Everyone at Bundoora Scout Group wishes you a Merry Christmas, Happy New Year and safe travels over the school holidays.

See you all in 2020 for more adventures!
