The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the world in more ways than one. From social distancing to lockdowns, the virus  impacted every aspect of our lives, including projects like the Bundoora Scouts bio garden. However, despite the setbacks caused by the pandemic, our bio garden has finally been completed! This is a great achievement, not just for the Bundoora Cub Scouts but also for the community at large.

The bio garden was initially started as a project to promote environmental awareness in our youth members. Started in early 2021 and was expected to be completed within 6 months. However, the pandemic forced Bundoora Scouts to put the project on hold for several months. With restrictions on social gatherings and movement, it was impossible to continue working on the garden. However, the Scouts did not give up. Instead, they used the downtime to plan and refine their ideas for the garden. The Scouts worked tirelessly to complete the project, and now in 2023 we're pleased to announce that the Bundoora Cub Scouts bio garden is finally finished.

The completion of the Bundoora Scouts bio garden is a testament to the resilience and determination of the Scouts and the community as a whole. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, our Scouts never gave up on their vision of creating a sustainable, environmentally-friendly garden. The garden is now a valuable resource for the local community, providing educational opportunities, and a space for people to come together and connect with nature.

In conclusion, the completion of the Bundoora Scouts bio garden is a shining example of what can be achieved when Scouts come together to work towards a common goal. The pandemic may have caused significant delays in the project, but it did not dampen the spirit or determination of the Scouts. The garden is now a source of pride and inspiration for the community and a reminder that even in the face of adversity, we can still achieve great things.

Yours in Scouting,  
Kate (Kaa)
